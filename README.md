# BEV3 `(v3.0)`
BasicEventViewer BEV3 

 Basic Event Viewer v3.0 For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 , .NET Framework 3.5 and in may 2022 Updated for ver (4.5) , Published by Damon Mohammadbagher.
 
 Note: I Created this code in 2009 & in May 2022 Updated by me for Work with Win7/Win10 etc (working with .NetFramework 4.5),
 also Some Security Features Like Working with "ETWProcessMon2/ETWPM2Monitor2/Sysmon Logs & MITRE ATT&CK" will add this Source Code soon! ;)
 
 useful for Windows Admins also All Blue Teamers too.
 
 this code still has some problem for loading Large Event log records like 400,000 records etc , time to loading is very slow (not fast) for these large records
 so i need to work on this for better performance , with new codes and i will update source codes soon for fix this problem also i will add
 new security features to the source code too.
